# Securing a Web Application with Spring Security

Spring Security simplifies web application security. This project demonstrates how to configure basic authentication, restrict access based on user roles, and use login forms.

## Key Steps:

1. **Add Dependencies**:  
   Add the required Spring Security dependencies to `pom.xml`.

2. **Configure Security**:  
   Implement `SecurityConfig.java` by overriding the `configure()` method to manage role-based access and login/logout behaviors.

3. **Create a Login Page**:  
   Build a simple form-based login page.

4. **Test Access**:  
   Verify restricted access to protected URLs.
